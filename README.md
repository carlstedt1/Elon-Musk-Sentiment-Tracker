# Elon Musk Sentiment Tracker
 
Using NLTK, spaCy and an NMF model, I analysed Elon Musk's tweets to track sentiment over time, and looked for a relationship with Teslaâ€™s stock price.

This project combined my use of Twitter with my interest in the stock market and macroeconomics, blending social media analytics with financial analysis to try and highlight sentiment importance on financial forecasting.
